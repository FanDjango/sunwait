This Makefile can be used to build sunwait as a package for OpenWRT.

Dependency: OpenWRT SDK

Instructions:
- Download the OpenWRT SDK for your platform from;
https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/xx.xx.x/targets/{platform}/generic/openwrt-sdk_*.tar.xz

- Extract it to somewhere;
tar -xf openwrt-sdk_*.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz

- Enter the sdk root;
cd openwrt-sdk_*.Linux-x86_64

- Set it up;
./scripts/feeds update -a

- Copy the Makefile from this path into the sdk, at;
